	  Linux Containers (LXC), provides the ability to group and
	  isolate of a set of processes in a jail by virtualizing and
	  accounting the kernel resources. It is similar to
	  Linux-Vserver or Openvz.

	  This only select the liblxc library (used for example with libvirt).
	  You need to select other options bellow to also install the lxc-*
	  binary utilities if you need them.

      Build and install the lxc-* utilities (lxc-create, lxc-start,
      etc.). Disable this option if you only require the liblxc library
      (for example to be used with libvirt utilities).

    bool "use the 'lxc' multicall binary"

      Build the lxc tools as a unique lxc binary to which other lxc-*
      commands point as symbolic links. This optimizes the package size.
